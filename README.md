# Swift Score

This project aims to create an iPad app to assist with the preparation of musical scores. Very few available apps utilise the versatility of the touch screen for composition, so this project intends to explore the area further, developing powerful but easy to use musical notation tools.

## Getting Started

To install this iOS app, clone the project and open swift-score.xcworkspace in Xcode. Once you've configured the project with your own developer account, you should then be able to install the app to a physical iPad or iPad simulator.
